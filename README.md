# Ticket Management System

## Summary
The Ticket Management System is an internal organizational tool designed to
capture, track, and resolve issues through a structured and role-based process.
It replaces informal communication channels with a centralized system that
ensures accountability, visibility, and controlled workflows.

The project focuses on system design, business logic, and access control rather
than just CRUD functionality, making it suitable for real-world enterprise use.


## Problem Statement

such as WhatsApp groups or emails, leading to poor tracking, no accountability,
and delayed resolution.

This system centralizes issue reporting and resolution using a structured,
role-based workflow.
